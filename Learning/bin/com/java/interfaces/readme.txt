Abstract:

1. A method with out body, is call abstract methods
2. If a class is having an abstract methods, we need to define our class as abstract class.
3. If we want only our class to be access via inheritence, then defining the class as abstract will enforce inheritence.
4, If a class is not providing implementation for all the abstract methods of an interface then need to define the class as abstract
